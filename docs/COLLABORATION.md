# 🤝 Collaboration Standards & "Definition of Done"

**Philosophy**: We treat this portfolio as a "Production-Grade" application. No "it works on my machine" excuses.

## The QA Specialist's Workflow

1.  **Spec First**: All features begin with a requirement (Task).
2.  **Test Driven (Ideal)**: We write tests for critical paths (`tests/e2e`).
3.  **Code**: We implement using React + TypeScript (Strict Mode).
4.  **Verify**:
    *   `npm run lint`: Zero Lint Errors (Includes WCAG 2.2).
    *   `npm run format`: Prettier compliance.
    *   `npm run test:e2e`: Playwright Green across all devices.

## Technology Decisions
*   **Why Vite?** Instant feedback loop.
*   **Why No Tailwind?** To demonstrate mastery of CSS Fundamentals (Modules/Variables) and "Steampunk" aesthetic formatting.
*   **Why Playwright?** It's the industry standard for reliable E2E automation.

## Asset Generation Strategy ("Nanono Banana Pro")
We use high-fidelity GenAI to create the "Elegant Steampunk" assets, ensuring unique, non-stock imagery that aligns with the personal brand.
